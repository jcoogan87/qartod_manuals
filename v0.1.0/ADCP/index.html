<h2 id="10-background-and-introduction">1.0 Background and Introduction</h2>
<p>The U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) has a vested interest in collecting high quality data for the 34 core variables
([https://ioos.noaa.gov/about/ioos-by-the-numbers(https://ioos.noaa.gov/about/ioos-by-the-numbers)]) measured on a national scale.
In response to this interest,
U.S. IOOS continues to establish written,
authoritative procedures for the quality control (QC) of real-time data through the Quality Assurance/Quality Control of Real-Time Oceanographic Data (QARTOD) Project,
addressing each variable as funding permits.
This manual on the real-time QC of in-situ current observations was first published in June 2013 as the third core variable to be addressed,
was updated in October 2015,
and is now the third core variable to receive a second update.</p>

and Quality Assurance of Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler Observations. 52 pp.
https://doi.org/10.25923/sqe9-e
</code></pre></div>
<p>This document follows and expands on the National Surface Currents Plan (U.S. IOOS 2015 ).
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) and Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS),
well-recognized as established providers of current data,
have long led the Nation with current observation programs.
NDBC and CO-OPS have decades of experience applying QC checks for hundreds of deployments (NDBC 2009).
However,
the observation locations were based on local project or user requirements,
resulting in a useful but ad hoc network with limited integration.
The National Surface Currents Plan addresses this situation by defining a comprehensive current-observing network for the United States.</p>
<p>The National Surface Currents Plan documents the extensive effort that QARTOD workshops devoted to QC of currents data.
The process for the development,
distribution,
review,
refinement,
and revision of this manual continues the QARTOD effort through collaboration by the QARTOD Board of Advisors,
all the U.S. IOOS Regional Associations,
manufacturers,
and operators.
Operators,
individuals or entities who are responsible for collecting and providing currents data,
are a key part of this endeavor.</p>
<p>This manual is a living document that reflects the state-of-the-art QC testing procedures for in-situ current observations using acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) and single-point current meters.
It is written for the experienced operator but also provides examples for those who are just entering the field.</p>
<h2 id="20-purposeconstraintsapplications">2.0 Purpose/Constraints/Applications</h2>
<p>The following sections describe the purpose of this manual,
as well as the constraints that operators may encounter when performing QC of in-situ current data and specific applications of those data.</p>
<h3 id="21-purpose">2.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to provide guidance to the U.S. IOOS and the in-situ currents community at large for the real-time QC of in-situ current measurements using an agreed-upon,
documented,
and implemented standard process.
This manual is also a deliverable to the U.S. IOOS Regional Associations and the ocean-observing community and represents a contribution to a collection of core variable QC documents.</p>
<p>This manual documents a series of test procedures for ocean currents data QC.
Current observations covered by these procedures are collected in oceans,
coastal waters,
and lakes in real time or near-real time.
The scope of real time has expanded to accommodate the span of the 34 variables covered by U.S. IOOS. The characteristics of real time (in no particular order) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>data delivered as soon as possible after acquisition for immediate use</li>
<li>a time series extending only backwards in time, where the next data point is not available</li>
<li>sample intervals from a few seconds to a few hours or even days, depending upon the variable</li>
</ul>
<p>High quality marine observations require sustained quality assurance (QA) and QC practices to ensure credibility and value to operators and data users.
QA practices involve processes that are employed with hardware to support the generation of high-quality data,
such as the use and application of a sufficiently accurate, precise,
and reliable sensor with adequate resolution.
Other QA practices include sensor calibration;
calibration checks,
and/or in-situ verification,
including post-deployment calibration;
proper deployment considerations,
such as measures for corrosion control and anti-fouling;
solid data communications;
adequate maintenance intervals;
and creation of a robust quality-control process.
Post-deployment calibration (instrument verification after recovery) issues are not part of the scope of this manual.
Although QC and QA are interrelated and important to the process,
QA considerations are addressed separately in appendix B.</p>
<p>QC involves follow-on steps that support the delivery of high-quality data and requires both automation and human intervention.
QC practices include such things as data integrity checks (format, checksum, timely arrival of data),
data value checks (threshold checks, minimum/maximum rate of change),
neighbor checks,
climatology checks,
model comparisons,
signal/noise ratios,
the mark-up of the data,
the verification of user satisfaction,
and generation of data flags (Bushnell 2005).</p>
<p>These procedures are written as a high-level narrative from which computer code can be developed to generate specific data flags (data quality indicators) within an automated software program.
A code repository exists at <a href="https://github.com/ioos/qartod">https://github.com/ioos/qartod</a>,
where operators may find or post examples of code in use.
Although certain tests are recommended,
thresholds can vary among operators.
The tests described here are designed to support a range of current sensors and operator capabilities.
Some well-established programs with the highest standards have implemented very rigorous QC processes.
Others,
with different requirements,
may utilize sensors with data streams that cannot support as many QC checks—all have value when used prudently.
Users must understand and appropriately utilize data of varying quality,
and operators must provide support by documenting and publishing their QC processes.
A balance must be struck between the time-sensitive needs of real-time observing systems and the degree of rigor that has been applied to non-real-time systems by operators with decades of QC experience.</p>
<p>These tests apply only to the in-situ,
real-time measurement of current points and current profiles as observed by sensors deployed on fixed or moored platforms and not to sensors deployed on moving platforms (e.g., drifting buoys, autonomous marine vehicles, ships) or remotely sensed current measurements (e.g., high frequency radar).</p>
<p>Through the process of the first four QARTOD workshops,
a set of guidelines were collected and submitted to the Ocean.US Data Management and Communications (DMAC) Steering Committee (Bouchard et al. 2007).
Those guidelines were adapted from existing guidelines developed and implemented by established providers of currents data,
as well as participating manufacturers of current-measuring systems—Nortek,
SonTek,
and Teledyne RDI.
Additionally,
the individual tests have been mapped to existing tests of UNESCO (1993).</p>
<p>The following list includes currents data providers (operators) and manufacturers who contributed to developing this manual.
Also included is the specific sensor manufacturer and where possible the individual sensors associated with the data provider.
This list is not intended to be comprehensive but as a means to acknowledge the efforts of these operators and manufacturers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, NDBC, University of South Florida (Teledyne RDI 1200, 600, 300, 75, and 38 kHz Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers)</li>
<li>CO-OPS (Teledyne RDI 1200, 600, 300 , and 75 kHz ADCPs; Nortek Aquadopp; SonTek 1000, 500, and 250 kHz ADP Acoustic Doppler Profilers)</li>
<li>USACE FRF (Teledyne RDI, Nortek Aquadopp)</li>
<li>Shell Oil Company (Teledyne RDI)</li>
</ul>
<p>The process of ensuring data quality is not always straightforward.
QA and QC procedures may be specific to a sensor technology or even to a particular manufacturer's model,
so the establishment of a methodology that is applicable to every sensor is challenging.</p>
<h3 id="22-data-processing-methodology">2.2 Data Processing Methodology</h3>
<p>The type of sensor system used to collect the data and the system used to process and transmit the information impact the QC algorithms that can be used on the data.
In-situ systems with sufficient onboard processing power within the sensor and limited data transmission capability may process the original (raw) measurement and produce product summaries,
such as mean currents.
If ample transmission capability is available,
the entire raw data stream may be transmitted ashore and subsequently quality controlled in real-time from there.
Therefore,
because operators have different data processing methodologies,
several levels of QC are proposed.</p>
<h3 id="23-traceability-to-an-accepted-standard">2.3 Traceability to an Accepted Standard</h3>
<p>To ensure that ADCPs are producing accurate data,
rigorous calibrations and calibration checks must be performed.
Most operators rely upon manufacturer-recommended calibrations and conduct calibration checks,
which are also usually described in their user manuals.
These activities are considered QA and are further addressed in appendix B.</p>
<p>Calibrations and calibration checks must be traceable to accepted standards.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (<a href="http://www.nist.gov/index.html">http://www.nist.gov/index.html</a>),
a provider of internationally accepted standards,
is often the source for accepted standards,
but there is no standard for measurement of currents.
These activities must rely upon the fundamental standards for length,
time,
and the earth's magnetic field.
Fortunately,
traceability to NIST is relatively easy because the standards for length,
time,
and compass-bearing are readily available at the resolutions required.</p>
<h3 id="24-sensor-deployment-considerations">2.4 Sensor Deployment Considerations</h3>
<p>Acoustic Doppler current meters and profilers can be mounted in a variety of configurations, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>in a platform sitting on the bottom, looking upward</li>
<li>on a buoy, looking downward</li>
<li>attached to a structure, looking horizontally (side-looking)</li>
<li>on an oil rig, looking in any direction</li>
<li>aboard a surface vessel underway</li>
<li>upward or downward on an autonomous underwater vehicle or glider</li>
<li>upward or downward on an in-line mooring</li>
</ul>
<p>Acoustic Doppler current meters and profilers may have two (the minimum required for horizontal profiling),
three,
four,
or more transducers.
In some cases,
redundant transducers over-resolve the current measurements,
and the results are used to provide an estimate of the quality of the observations.
In other cases,
multiple transducer pairings utilize different transmit frequencies and provide the benefits of longer range from a lower frequency and higher spatial resolution from the higher frequency (e.g., SonTek RiverSurveyor M9).
Some can also be configured to measure other variables as well,
such as waves,
turbulence,
ice tracking (e.g., Nortek Signature500) and biomass (e.g., Nortek Signature100).
Some examples of the variety of transducer configurations are shown in figs. 2-1 through 2-5.
This manual does not cover the QC of all possible configurations,
but it does include the most widely used tests provided by participating operators.
Notes within each specific test provide application guidance.</p>

<h3 id="25-hardware-limitations">2.5 Hardware Limitations</h3>
<p>Advances in ADCP sensor technology have eliminated many of the problems encountered in older devices.
Sensors are now smaller,
more reliable,
and draw less power.
Ancillary sensors can be employed to make corrections,
and most notably,
signal processing hardware and software capabilities have grown enormously.</p>
<p>ADCP current sensors can withstand moderate bio-fouling,
but observational accuracy gradually degrades as marine growth becomes excessive.
As the bio-mass increases on the ADCP transducers,
effective acoustic power output and transducer reception sensitivity also degrade,
leading to reduced signal-to-noise ratios and less accurate observations.
ADCPs using pressure sensors may find dampened output as the orifice becomes obstructed.
The degree of bio-fouling will vary depending on a number of factors,
but in some instances,
effective anti-fouling materials and coatings may permit system deployments in excess of two years.</p>
<p>As with all instruments,
ADCPs are depth/range limited by the pressure housing.
ADCP measurements are further depth/range limited in two fundamental ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>the acoustic signal strength loss over distance (higher frequency systems have shorter ranges) and</li>
<li>the acoustic beams spread with increasing range,
   both within an individual beam and among the multiple beams,
   which leads to reduced resolution and less certainty that the sampled field has uniform flow.
   Many of the QC tests address these limitations through the use of carefully selected thresholds and other test criteria.</li>
</ol>
<p>ADCP transducer side-lobe reflections must also be considered.
These reflections can come from the bottom,
the surface,
or adjacent structures and degrade ADCP performance.
These errors are mitigated by proper deployment procedures.
Manufacturer user manuals should be consulted to ensure that proper procedures are followed.</p>
<h3 id="26-other-important-considerations">2.6 Other Important Considerations</h3>
<p>Corrections for magnetic declination and deviation are important and must be given careful consideration.</p>
<p>Although these corrections are beyond the scope of this manual, manufacturers provide processes for making</p>
<p>corrections, which are specific to the sensor make/model, within their user manuals. Appendix B-3 provides</p>
<p>further information.</p>
<p>While outside the scope of the real-time tests described in this manual,
QA is critical to data quality.
Sensors require attention to proper QA measures both before and after the deployment (appendix B).
Operators must follow the manufacturer's recommendations for factory calibration schedules and proper sensor maintenance.</p>
<p>Also important,
but beyond the scope of this document at present,
is the determination and reporting of data uncertainty.
Knowledge of the accuracy of each observation is required to ensure that data are used appropriately and aids in the computation of error bounds for subsequent products derived by users.
All sensors and measurements contain errors that are determined by hardware quality,
methods of operation,
and data processing techniques.
Operators should routinely provide a quantitative measure of data uncertainty in the associated metadata.
Such calculations can be challenging,
so operators should also document the methods used to compute the uncertainty.
The limits and thresholds implemented by operators for the data QC tests described here are a key component in establishing the observational error bounds.
Operators are strongly encouraged to consider the impact of the QC tests on data uncertainty,
as these two efforts greatly enhance the utility of their data.</p>
<p>Sensor redundancy is key to obtaining measurements and ensuring that uncertainties can be assigned to those measurements.
Hence,
comparing two adjacent instruments can assist in evaluation of data quality,
as well as provide two (or more) independent estimates of a parameter of interest.
Variation in the estimated values can be useful in uncertainty calculations.</p>
<h2 id="30-quality-control">3.0 Quality Control</h2>
<p>To conduct real-time QC on current observations,
the first pre-requisite is to understand the science and context within which the measurements are being conducted.
Currents are dependent upon many things such as tidal forces,
density gradients,
winds,
and riverine flow.
The real-time QC of these observations can be extremely challenging.
Human involvement is therefore important to ensure that solid scientific principles are applied to the process to ensure that good data are not discarded,
and bad data are not distributed.
Examples include selection of appropriate thresholds and examination of data flagged as questionable.</p>
<p>This manual focuses specifically on real-time data,
so the operator is likely to encounter aspects of data QC where the flags and tests described in the following sections do not apply because the data are not considered to be real time.
For example,
for real-time QC,
drift (slow changes in sensor calibration) cannot be detected or corrected.
Fortunately,
sensor drift and drift correction are not typically issues for ADCPs (except for clock drift).
Another example might be the ability of some data providers to backfill data gaps.
In both of these examples,
the observations are not considered to be real time for purposes of QC checks.
(However, in some sophisticated 24/7 QC operations, real-time dissemination may be switched from one sensor to another based on real-time QC flags.)</p>
<h3 id="31-qc-flags">3.1 QC Flags</h3>
<p>Data are evaluated using QC tests,
and the results of those tests are recorded by inserting flags in the data files.
Table 3-1 provides a simple set of flags and associated descriptions.
Operators may incorporate additional flags for inclusion in metadata records.
For example,
an observation may fail the current speed test (test 10) and be flagged as having failed the test.
Additional flags may be incorporated to provide more detailed information to assist with troubleshooting.
If the data failed the current speed test by exceeding the upper limit,
a "failed high" flag may indicate that the values were higher than the expected range,
but such detailed flags primarily support maintenance efforts and are presently beyond U.S. IOOS requirements for QC of real-time data.
For additional information regarding flags,
see the <em>Manual for the Use of Real-Time Oceanographic Data Quality Control Flags</em> (U.S. IOOS 2017) posted on the U.S. IOOS QARTOD website.</p>
<p>Further post-processing of the data may yield different conclusions from those reached during initial assessments.
Flags set in real-time should not be changed to ensure that historical documentation is preserved.
Results from post-processing should generate another set of flags.</p>
<p>Observations are time ordered,
and the most recent observation is <em>n<sub>0</sub></em>,
preceded by a value at <em>n-1</em>,
and so on backwards in time.
The focus of this manual is primarily on the real-time QC of observations <em>n</em>,
<em>n-1</em>,
and <em>n-2</em>.</p>

<h3 id="32-qc-test-types-and-hierarchy">3.2 QC Test Types and Hierarchy</h3>
<p>This section outlines the 20 real-time QC tests that are required and recommended for in-situ currents.
Tests are listed in table 3-2 and are divided into four groups according to test type.
The tests in group 1 (table 3-3) are required (where possible) for all current measurements collected for U.S. IOOS.
However,
the output of some instruments is not sufficient for some tests.
Operators must consider each test in group 2 to determine if it can be applied in their particular instance—not all tests can be implemented in all situations.
Operators should also consider that some of these tests can be carried out within the instrument,
where thresholds can be defined in configuration files.
Although more tests imply a more robust QC effort,
there are many reasons operators could use to justify not conducting some tests.
In those cases,
operators need only to document reasons these tests do not apply to their observations.
Such flexibility is needed to support the U.S. IOOS Regional Information Coordination Entities certification effort (IOOC 2012),
since the number of tests conducted and the justification for not applying some tests are useful for evaluating an operator's skill level.
Even though currently there are no suggested tests,
group 3 is retained as a placeholder for possible future additions.</p>

<p>: Table 3-3. QC tests in order of requirement hierarchy</p>
<p>Some effort will be needed to select the best thresholds,
which are determined at the operator level and may require trial and error/iteration before final selections are made.
A successful QC effort is highly dependent upon selection of the proper thresholds,
which should not be determined arbitrarily but can be based on a number of criteria,
such as historical knowledge,
statistics derived from more recently acquired data,
and manufacturer recommendations.
Although this manual provides some guidance for selecting thresholds based on input from various operators,
it is assumed that operators have the subject matter expertise as well as a sincere interest in selecting the proper thresholds to maximize the value of their QC effort.
Operators are required to openly provide thresholds as metadata for user support.
This shared information will help U.S. IOOS to document standardized thresholds to be included in future releases of this manual.</p>
<h3 id="33-qc-test-descriptions">3.3 QC Test Descriptions</h3>
<p>A variety of tests can be performed on the sensor measurements to evaluate data quality.
Testing the integrity of the data transmission is a first step.
If the data are corrupted during transmission,
further testing may be irrelevant.
The checks defined in these 20 tests evaluate data through various comparisons to other data and to the expected conditions in the given environment.
The tests listed in this section presume a time-ordered series of observations (..., <em>n-2</em>, <em>n-1</em>, <em>n</em>) and denote the most recent observation as previously described.</p>
<p>For each test described,
<em>i</em> represents the bin number (range cell within a beam),
with bin one being closest to the instrument,
and <em>j</em> represents the beam number.</p>
<p>The test descriptions provided are examples of tests that may be employed.
They are not intended to be the only acceptable tests,
rather they serve to clearly identify the intent of the test.
The examples are the best available at present and will be improved in updated manuals as tests are implemented.
Specifically,
the rate-of-change and spike tests are surprisingly challenging and have deficiencies as presently described.
Both tests may suffer from false failure of subsequent valid observations when recovering from the initial detection of a flawed observation.
Operators are strongly encouraged to share improved versions of all tests as they are developed.</p>

Test specifications to be established by the manufacturer.
Example: Correlation Magnitude (in counts) ≥3 beams need to pass test <code>CMAGMIN = 65</code>, <code>CMAGMAX = 140</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Percent Good (Test 9) – Strongly Recommended</strong></p>
<p>Percentage of high data quality measurements to produce good velocities.
A key quality control parameter,
percent good,
indicates what fraction of the pings passed the various error thresholds.
The percent good test determines whether the data that are being returned are sufficient to provide the required data quality.
Different methods are used by different manufacturers.
For Teledyne RDI,
there are percent good three-beam <code>[PG1(j)]</code> solutions (one beam rejected) and percent good four-beam <code>[PG4(j)]</code> solutions.
This test is applied to each depth bin, <code>i</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Error Velocity (Test 14) – Strongly Recommended</strong></p>
<p>Test that the error velocity is below an acceptable threshold.</p>
<p>Error velocity is a key QC parameter that derives from the four-beam geometry of an ADCP.
Each pair of opposing beams provides one measurement of the vertical velocity and one component of the horizontal velocity,
so there are two independent measurements of velocity that can be compared.
If the flow field is homogeneous
(<a href="http://www.teledynemarine.com/rdi">http://www.teledynemarine.com/rdi</a>),
the difference between these velocities will average to zero.
The error velocity can be treated as an indication of errors in the horizontal velocity measurements.</p>

<p><strong>u, v Spike (Test 16) – Strongly Recommended</strong></p>
<p>Test if u, v (n-1) values exceed selected thresholds relative to adjacent time series data points.</p>
<p>This check is for single-value spikes,
specifically the u, v values at point n-1.
Spikes consisting of more than one data point are difficult to capture,
but their onset may be flagged by the rate of change test.
This test is applied to each depth bin (<code>i</code>).
The spike test consists of two operator-selected thresholds,
<code>uv_SPIKE_FAIL</code> and <code>uv_SPIKE_SUSPECT</code>.
Adjacent data points u(_n<sub>-2</sub> and n<sub>0</sub>) are averaged to form a spike reference (<code>u_SPK_REF</code>),
and adjacent data points v(n-2 and n) are averaged to form a spike reference (<code>v_SPK_REF</code>).
Only adjacent data points that have been flagged pass should be used to form the spike reference.
When absent,
earlier observations may need to be employed.
The absolute value of the spike is tested to capture positive and negative spikes.
Large spikes are easier to identify as outliers and flag as failures.
Smaller spikes may be real and are only flagged suspect.
The thresholds may be fixed values or dynamically established
(for example, a multiple of the standard deviation over an operator-selected period).
They may also be expressed as a function of time (e.g., d(u)/dt) to accommodate varying time increments.
An alternative spike test may use a third difference test,
for example defined as Diff<sub>n</sub> = u(n-3) - 3 _ u(n-2) + 3 _ u(n-1) - u(n).</p>

<h2 id="40-summary">4.0 Summary</h2>
<p>The QC tests in this currents document have been compiled from QARTOD workshops (QARTOD 2003-2009).
Test suggestions came from several existing operators with extensive experience,
and wherever possible,
redundant tests have been merged.
The considerations of operators who ensure the quality of real-time data may be different from those whose data are not published in real time,
and these and other differences must be balanced according to the specific circumstances of each operator.
Although these real-time tests are required,
recommended,
or suggested,
it is the operator who is responsible for deciding which tests are appropriate.
Each operator selects thresholds based on the specific program requirements that must be met.
The scope of requirements can vary widely,
from complex data streams that support myriad QC checks to ensure precise and accurate measurements - to basic data streams that do not need such details.
Operators must publish their QC processes via metadata so that data users can readily see and understand the source and quality of those data.</p>
<p>The 20 QC tests identified apply to current observations from ADCPs and may apply to other types of current sensors.
All tests are either required or strongly recommended,
and they fall into four groups: sensor health,
signal quality,
current velocity,
and overall profile.
Further,
some tests operate on the raw data used to generate current observations,
while others apply to the derived current products.
The individual tests are described and include codable instructions,
output conditions,
example thresholds,
and exceptions (if any).</p>
<p>Selection of the proper thresholds is critical to a successful QC effort.
Thresholds can be based on historical knowledge or statistics derived from more recently acquired data,
but they should not be determined arbitrarily. This manual provides some guidance for selecting thresholds based on input from various operators,
but also notes that operators need the subject matter expertise as well as a sincere interest in selecting the proper thresholds to maximize the value of their QC effort.</p>
<p>Sensors continue to become "smarter" and interoperable.
For example,
some QC procedures may be embedded within the sensor instrumentation package.
Significant components of metadata will reside in the instrument and be transmitted either on demand or automatically along with the data stream.
Users may also reference metadata through Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to simplify the identification of which QC steps have been applied to data.
However,
QARTOD QC test procedures in this manual address only real-time,
in-situ observations made by sensors on fixed or mobile platforms.
The tests do not include post-processing,
which is not conducted in real time but may be useful for ecosystem-based management,
or delayed-mode,
which is required for climate studies.</p>
<p>Future QARTOD reports will address standard QC procedures and best practices for all types of common as well as uncommon platforms and sensors for all the U.S. IOOS core variables.
Each QC manual is envisioned as a dynamic document and will be posted on the QARTOD website at <a href="https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/qartod/">https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/qartod</a>.
This process allows for QC manual updates as technology development occurs for both upgrades of existing sensors and new sensors.</p>
